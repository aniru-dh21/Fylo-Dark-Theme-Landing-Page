<h2 id="overview">Challenge Overview</h2>

<p>The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
<p>Users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
  <li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="built-with">Built With</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
  <li>CSS custom properties</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Vanilla JS</li>
  <li>Mobile-first workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learnt">What I learned</h2>

<p>At first, I was apprehensive about creating responsive websites that could work across multiple devices. Looking at other people's code for mobile views only added to my anxiety. However, I decided to tackle this challenge head-on by taking on a project, and I am proud to say that I have successfully created a fully responsive website.</p>
<p>Although it was not an easy task and required some time, the experience helped me learn many small details that I used to overlook or make mistakes in. </p>
<ul>
	<li>For instance, I now understand the distinction between padding and margin, and how they can achieve the same layout changes while having different effects on the design. </li>
	<li>I also realized the importance of reviewing each section of the website after completion, even if it seemed satisfactory at first glance. This approach helped me identify mistakes and enhance the overall quality of the site. </li>
	<li>I made a conscious effort to avoid adding unnecessary pieces of code that did not contribute much to the page and focused on making the code more readable so that anyone could understand any segment easily. </li>
	<li>Furthermore, I learned about small features that could enhance the accessibility of the website for screen readers and other assistive technologies. I incorporated these features into my project to make it more inclusive and accessible to everyone.</li>
</ul>
